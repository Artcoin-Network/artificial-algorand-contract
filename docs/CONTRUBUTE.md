## Python Package Manager

- Adding a package should be done with [`poetry add`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add), since we are using poetry. The initialization `poetry install` will benefit from this.

## TODO

- [ ] Exporter should be a module like py-leet-runner.
- [ ] Need fix `$ART$`: temp asset name.
- [ ] Finish [asset.py](./../artificial_algorand_contract/classes/asset.py): create asset, remove asset, transfer asset, etc. Also open AlgoExplore.
- [ ] Open disposer after account creation.
- [x] remove sensitive data like test account mnemonics before making this repo public
- [x] The purpose of the repo has changed to be only for smart contracts on Algorand blockchain. So should we refactor this repo.
